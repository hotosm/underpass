# DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS is used to change the configuration of the
# packages that get built. This is used for both the debian/rules
# file and here. By default, this looks for the value in the users
# environment, which is what dpkg-buildpackage does as well. If
# DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS is defined on the command line to make, then
# that value takes precedence. Once we have the value of the
# build options, we can then see what is enabled or not. The
# default produces a package with normal defaults.
