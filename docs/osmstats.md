# OSM Stats

The Red Cross maintains statistics of changes, so itâ€™s possible to
track the mapping progress of individual users, teams, and mapping
campaigns. Underpass writes directly to the postgres database used for
OSM Stats. Underpass has the ability to recreate this database and
populate it with data from the raw data files. Underpass uses
[replication change files](changefile.md) to update these tables. The
database schema contains a number of tables which are documented here:

&nbsp;
## OSM Stats Tables

The OSM schema contains a number of tables, which are designed to
support the web front end. the **raw_** tables are mostly static, and
are simply a matching of an ID to a name for display. There are other
smaller tables for the same purpose, usedc to group queries together
for the front-end.

## raw_changesets Table

The main table is raw_changesets, which contains extracted data from
the two files is then processed to create the various statistics. The
counters use the existing data, and only add to this value based on
what is in the change file, as this requires much less processing
time. This is the primary table Underpass updates the data in.
